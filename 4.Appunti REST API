Spring Data Rest will expose ALL this "ENDPOINT" for free!

CRUD Operations:

POST/products               -> Create a product
GET/products                -> Read ALL product
GET/products/{id}           -> Read a specific product
PUT/products/{id}           -> Update a specific product
DELETE/products/{id}        -> Delete a specific product

We don't want anyone on the outside could add or delete or update some product, but that they can Read-only!
So we need to DISABLE -> Post, Put, Delete
and just ABLE -> Get

How can we Able just the GET Api?
Usiamo SPRING DATA REST , ma ricordandoci di disabilitare le Post, Put e Delete nella Configurazione.
Nella classe "MyDatRestConfig" noi andiamo a configurare le nostre API REST , disabilitando i metodi HTTP Post,
Put e Delete.

It DISABLE the HTTP Methods for POST, PUT, DELETE.
We will need also the REST API Security, which we will see later.
